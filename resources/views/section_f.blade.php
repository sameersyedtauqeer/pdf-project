                                        should advertise when first opening the business.

                                        very valuable because they help the public recognize us. To preserve and enhance

                                        The staging of a grand opening celebration can significantly promote the initial
                                        acceptance and success of your Kosha Hibachi. A grand opening will attract
                                        public attention, and it can build genuine enthusiasm among your staff. A Field
                                        Consultant from Kosha Hibachi LLC will be available for up to a week during your
                                        first month of operations to assist and advise you with your grand opening and
                                        other start-up considerations. You can expect full support from the franchisor
                                        during the launch of your new business.

                                        The primary focus of the Kosha Hibachi marketing program is to use social and
                                        web-based media to get the concept out in front of more people. Franchisees are
                                        expected to manage social media platforms designed specifically for their
                                        business.
                                        The Corporate Office will market all franchisee locations and territories on all
                                        social media outlets. Franchisees may submit posts and/or content to the
                                        Corporate
                                        Office for approval. In addition to standard social media posts, having an
                                        individual (not the franchisee company) repost your franchisee social media
                                        posts to
                                        local groups is a great way to draw more attention and bring in new customers.
                                        It is
                                        wise to have several different types of social media posts each week: daily
                                        posts
                                        showing the food and the trailer’s location and hours for the day, weekly posts
                                        sharing that your franchise location offers catering services for private events
                                        and
                                        travels for public events, and a weekly marketing post that you “renew” each
                                        week.
                                        It is wiser to “renew” your marketing post instead of creating new marketing
                                        posts,
                                        as the comments and interactions will add up if it’s the same post, and when a
                                        new
                                        customer sees a promoted post with thousands of likes it looks better than
                                        seeing a
                                        new post with ten likes.

                                        When considering the purchase of radio time on a particular station, think about

                                        income, and educational background). Purchase radio time on a station that plays

                                        Repetition of an ad is an important factor in radio marketing. Many believe that
                                        frequent repetition during a limited period makes a lasting impression and is
                                        more easily recalled by listeners. According to this view, it is better to buy
                                        four spot announcements in one week than it is to buy four spot announcements
                                        over a period of a month. Consult with your Field Consultant for advice on
                                        repetition frequency and its relevance to the Kosha Hibachi concept.

                                        A third consideration should be the time the radio spot runs. It may be
                                        beneficial to schedule spots when your customers are most likely to be listening
                                        to the radio. However, prime air times also carry prime rates.

                                        Do not forget that the best free marketing you can ever get is through your
                                        guests. Referrals are probably the most important way of generating new
                                        business. If you provide high quality service each and every time, your
                                        reputation will spread throughout the community in which you are located.

                                        No amount of marketing, promotional materials, or free giveaways can ever
                                        compensate for poor service, inferior food, or unprofessional behavior. If you
                                        maintain Kosha Hibachi standards of excellence for its food and service, as well
                                        as integrity and cooperation, you will find that the free marketing you receive
                                        from your guests will be overwhelming with praise.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On the other hand, if you do not maintain Kosha Hibachi standards, you will find
                                        that this form of marketing can destroy your business. Treat your best marketing
                                        resource—your guests—with great care. Make sure your guests not only say good
                                        things about the food and service they received but make sure they perceive real
                                        value from Kosha Hibachi.

                                        Participation in community festivals and events such as block parties offers a

                                        give you valuable exposure to both the public and other participating
                                        businesses. This is a centerpiece of the Kosha Hibachi business model. By being
                                        at local events, fairs and festivals, you create revenue opportunities for the
                                        business and marketing opportunities for our brand.

                                        As a franchisee, you should utilize various networking tools to get additional
                                        information on where events will be taking place, and how to participate. Tools
                                        that can be used include the following:

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Facebook typically has local groups that show all of the future events being
                                        held in a certain county or city; the events nearly always need food trust and
                                        this is a great opportunity for you to sign up to serve at those events. Look
                                        for events that have high attendance expectations, little or no fee to serve at
                                        the event, and fewer food trucks in attendance. It is wise to plan these events
                                        ahead of time so you have a good idea of your schedule for the next 2-3 months.
                                        Once you find some good events, ask the organizer if you can go ahead and
                                        schedule to return next year. After about a year of operating, you should have a
                                        good portion of the following year’s events scheduled with events that you know
                                        you will do well at!

                                        materials, you will be certain to consistently maintain the Kosha Hibachi logo,
                                        theme, style, and message—which benefits you and all other franchisees. While it
                                        is never our intent to stifle any franchisee’s initiative in generating new and
                                        effective marketing or promotional material, you may find it makes sense to use
