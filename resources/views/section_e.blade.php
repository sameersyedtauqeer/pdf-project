                                        will carefully review and test them to be sure they will be beneficial to the
                                        franchise system. We will then send them to you to be included in this manual.
                                        You will be expected to implement these new procedures in your operation.
                                        Although we understand your independence as a businessperson is important to
                                        you, we all benefit by working as a team to share the techniques that can

                                        Especially critical are the opening procedures since they provide the foundation
                                        from which all other procedures follow. If the opening procedures are not
                                        correctly executed, a “domino effect” may be created, resulting in an
                                        unnecessary delay in opening the operation itself, general unpreparedness for
                                        ongoing daily tasks, less than satisfactory guest service, and subsequent loss
                                        of revenues.

                                        The shift change and closing procedures are also important since they conclude
                                        the shift or day’s business and prepare the trailer and tent for the following
                                        shift or day’s business.

                                        Opening, shift change and closing procedures, then, help set the tone and pace
                                        for the business as a whole. Therefore, they need to be conscientiously

                                        The purpose of the checklists on the following pages is to provide you with a
                                        well-planned procedure for opening, managing the shift change, and closing down
                                        your trailer. This helps ensure your business is operationally sound, that
                                        customers are happy, that labor costs are minimized and that you manage your
                                        time more effectively.

                                        The checklists are not meant to be all inclusive. Although prioritized to make
                                        your job easier, they are only meant to serve as a guide. Your geographic
                                        location, availability of good labor and other priorities will dictate your
                                        opening and closing needs. Use the checklist as a starting point and make
                                        changes where necessary.

                                        We typically have Sysco orders delivered at around 8:30am on Mondays for the
                                        entire week. We use a key-drop system where the Sysco delivery driver knows
                                        where a key to the commissary kitchen is hidden, he puts the food in the
                                        commercial coolers, and then locks the door on his way out. The chef arrives
                                        around 9AM and begins prepping the meats, veggies, rice, and sauce for the week.
                                        This process takes about 1.5hrs in total and all food will be prepped for the
                                        week ahead.

                                        Everything you and your staff do is directly or indirectly related to customer
                                        service. Customers should see enthusiasm and employees who take pride in the way

                                        food, delivering orders to the customer, or answering the phone, should be
                                        working for guests -- keeping their satisfaction is the most important aspect of

                                        Our main objective at Kosha Hibachi is guest satisfaction and delivering the
                                        most amazing and unique experience to the customer each and every time. If a
                                        guest seems hesitant about what to order, describe our ingredients. Be prepared
                                        to answer any questions about the flavor, portion, and price of each item so you
                                        can knowledgeably make recommendations. Additionally, it would be wise to have
                                        knowledge of what ingredients are in each meal for customers with questions
                                        about allergies. Suggestive selling is an excellent way to make sure guests have
                                        remembered to order everything they need for a totally satisfying experience.

                                        When developing good service, promote the following qualities: promptness,
                                        courtesy, good manners, enthusiasm, and teamwork. In short, project a
                                        professional attitude. Unless you attain this goal, you will not be able to
                                        provide the high quality of service expected from Kosha Hibachi.

                                        If you need to obtain additional information from another employee, always ask
                                        for permission to place the caller on hold. Ask your caller, “Do you mind

                                        When the caller has been on hold longer than 30-45 seconds, give them the option
                                        to continue to hold or ask if they would rather have someone call them back.
                                        When returning to the caller, always remember to thank them for waiting!

                                        deliveries or the flu has affected your staff), the guests’ primary concern
                                        while visiting Kosha Hibachi is their own satisfaction.

                                        inform the guest of the situation and provide reassurance that you will resolve
                                        the problem as soon as possible.

                                        can to resolve problems themselves unless the guest specifically requests the
                                        owner/manager. If a guest asks to see the manager, have your employees relay all
                                        pertinent information about the problem to you first so you are fully prepared
                                        to assist the guest.

                                        Remember that the majority of dissatisfied guests do not complain--they simply
                                        do not come back. Your best line of defense is to prevent dissatisfaction in the
                                        first place.

                                        Do not accept any currency you suspect to be counterfeit. (Many banks offer
                                        seminars for personnel on how to identify counterfeit money. Check with your
                                        local bank for what to look for in counterfeit bills.)

                                        When a guest hands you currency, announce the amount of the sale and the
                                        denomination of the bill the guest gave you. Keep the bill in sight until you
                                        have made the correct change. Always count change back aloud.

                                        Never let a guest rush or confuse you by intimidation when paying by cash. This
                                        is common practice for con artists. If a guest claims you have not given the
                                        correct change, and you are not sure, take the guest’s name and telephone
                                        number. Politely explain that after the cash drawer has been balanced, he will
                                        be contacted if there has been an error. If a guest objects when an employee
                                        follows this procedure, the owner or manager should personally address the
                                        situation.

                                        Many of our guests are not familiar with our special items. As their
                                        intermediary, you are in the position to smooth the way. Above all, be sincere
                                        and honest. Always do what you truly believe is in the guest’s best interest.
                                        Recommend items you know are superior and you are certain they will enjoy.

                                        NEVER OVER SELL! Always allow the guest to finish ordering before you start
                                        suggesting. Be aware of what the guest is ordering and make sure s/he
                                        understands what they are getting.

                                        To sell effectively, you must sometimes bring a need or desire to try something
                                        to the surface. Make sure you use the right type of language.

                                        are prepared exactly to our specifications.

                                        Daily preparation is critical to the management of a well-run operation.
                                        Personnel must follow all prep procedures. To deviate from these procedures will
                                        mean sacrificing the superior product quality and service for which Kosha
                                        Hibachi is known.

                                        The most important thing that you and your employees can do to protect your
                                        guests is to wash your hands regularly. By frequently washing your hands, you
                                        wash away germs that you may have picked up from other people, from contaminated
                                        surfaces, or from animals. Once your hands pick up germs from other sources, you
                                        can easily infect yourself when touching eyes, nose, or mouth, or infect others
                                        through contaminating food or food preparation surfaces.

                                        Remember that, in addition to colds, some pretty serious diseases, including
                                        hepatitis A, meningitis, and infectious diarrhea, can easily be prevented if you
                                        and your crew make a habit of washing hands often. It is especially important to
                                        wash hands both before and after preparing or handling food, before eating, or
                                        after using the bathroom.

                                        Experts recommend the following guidelines for washing hands:

                                        <li>
                                            Next, rub your hands vigorously together for several seconds and scrub all
                                            surfaces.
                                        </li>

                                            Keep in mind that it’s the soap combined with the scrubbing action that
                                            helps to dislodge and remove the germs.

                                        There is a difference between cleaning and disinfecting. Cleaning generally
                                        means that dirt is being removed, while the term disinfecting means those germs
                                        are being removed. While surfaces may look clean, many infectious germs can be
                                        lurking. Under certain conditions, some germs can live on surfaces for hours and
                                        even for days.

                                        are stored at the proper temperatures:

                                    </p>


                                    <ul class="s-15 fw-light">
                                        <li> Always make sure to refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared foods, and
                                            leftovers within two hours of purchase or preparation.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> Your refrigerator should be set at 40 °F to discourage the growth of
                                            food-borne bacteria. You can use a refrigerator or freezer thermometer to
                                            check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezers.
                                        </li>

                                        <li> Never attempt to defrost food at room temperature. To safely thaw food,
                                            place it in the refrigerator the night before. For quick thawing, submerge
                                            food in cold water in airtight packaging. You can also use a microwave to
                                            thaw food if you plan to use it immediately.</li>
                                        <li> When storing leftover food products, it is important that the temperature
                                            of food products be reduced rapidly to discourage bacterial growth.
                                        </li>

                                            electrical equipment to keep it operating efficiently. It is also important

                                        <li> Most mechanical equipment needs some form of lubrication. Check
                                            manufacturers’ specifications for your equipment, and make sure moving parts
                                            are lubricated properly. Lack of lubrication can lead to rapid and premature
                                            deterioration of bearings, which in turn, leads to unnecessary repair bills.

                                            Proper circulation is the key to an efficient refrigeration system. Make
                                            sure cases of goods are not stored too close to fan coils, as this will
                                            restrict air flow and reduce a unit’s efficiency.
                                        </li>

                                        <li> Check door gaskets for cracks and other damage.

                                        <li> Make sure hinges and latches are secured to the frames of coolers and
                                            freezers. Also, check door seals.

                                            Make sure coolers and freezers are sitting level so doors stay shut. When
                                            a cooler or freezer door is left ajar, the compressor runs continuously
                                            since it can’t maintain the air temperature because of the warm air that
                                            continues to enter the unit.
                                        </li>

                                        <li> Monitor temperatures in all refrigeration units by checking accurate
                                            thermometers on a frequent basis. Temperature change should be your first
                                            indication of a food quality problem, a service problem, or an error in
                                            operational procedures.</li>
                                        <li> Replace air filters on the heating and air conditioning system at regular
                                            intervals. The efficiency of the system is reduced because of clogged air
                                            filters. Also, replace any loose or worn belts.</li>

                                        To minimize the chance of falls, immediately wipe up all spills, never stand on
                                        a countertop or climb on shelving, and wear rubber or non-skid-sole shoes.

                                        Rushing around is often a cause of accidents. Even at peak times, it is
                                        important to perform your work duties in a steady, consistent way, without
                                        rushing. At no time should there ever be running or horseplay. Always look in
                                        the direction you are walking; do not turn sharply or stop abruptly.

                                        The key to the success of any such plan is that all employees are given specific
                                        responsibilities and are instructed on how to perform these duties before the
                                        emergency occurs.

                                        <br>

                                        Train all employees in the location and use of fire extinguishers. Show all
                                        employees where the gas cut-offs are and how to turn off gas mains. Show all
                                        employees where the circuit breakers are and make sure all markings are clear.

                                        Check fire extinguishers monthly. Visually check the gauge to see that the fire
                                        extinguisher is charged, and the pin has not been pulled. If the pin in the
                                        handle has been pulled, the extinguisher may have been tampered with and
                                        activated. Also, look for signs of obvious physical damage, corrosion, or other
                                        impairments. Any signs of defect should indicate that the extinguisher needs a
                                        complete maintenance check by the supplier’s service personnel. Fire departments
                                        will check these periodically, as well.

                                        In the event of a fire, you should first do all you can to eliminate all danger
                                        to guests and employees. Secondly, try to minimize damage to the premises by
                                        extinguishing the fire or containing it until the fire department arrives.
                                        Depending on the size, nature, and progression of the fire, follow these
                                        procedures:
                                    </p>

                                            the nearest intersection. Remain on the phone until the dispatcher tells you
                                            to hang up.</li>

                                        yourself, your employees, and your guests from harm. Consider the following
                                        guidelines.

                                        If you suspect the trailer or surrounding area has been burglarized, contact the
                                        police immediately. Nothing should be touched until the police have arrived and
                                        have examined the premises.

                                        <li> Caution employees against discussing sales with anyone.</li>
                                        <li> Limit the number of key holders to as few as is practical.</li>
                                        <li> Inform employees that you will dismiss and/or prosecute any employee

                                        <li> Keep rear access doors locked when not in use.</li>
                                        <li> Insist that two employees close down the trailer. It is safer and they
                                            will encourage each other’s honesty.</li>
