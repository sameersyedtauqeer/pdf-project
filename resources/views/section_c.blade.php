                                        As the owner of a Kosha Hibachi franchise, you must be skilled in a number of
                                        areas if your business is to be a success. It is not enough to merely oversee
                                        routine operational tasks. Rather, you are fully responsible for keeping all
                                        costs under control, for keeping your employees motivated (if applicable), and
                                        for generating increased business. Consequently, you must be actively involved
                                        in financial and problem analysis, personnel management, and innovative
                                        marketing techniques.

                                        One of the primary responsibilities of managing a Kosha Hibachi is the
                                        management of the work schedule in order to manage the business effectively and
                                        appropriately according to the amount of business and events you are attending
                                        in your area. As a franchisee, it is important to understand how your employees
                                        and people work together and to also know how to best manage your labor costs
                                        and expenses.

                                        The person operating the trailer - the Chef - is required to arrive early enough
                                        to prepare the food so they can be fully operational during our business hours
                                        of 11AM – 2PM and 3PM – 7PM. The window attendant must arrive 15 minutes early
                                        for set up and stay 15 minutes late for take down.

                                        <br>

                                        “Shifts” may not be necessary since employees are needed only on a case-by-case
                                        basis. Most of the time, the franchise owners themselves will be operating the
                                        vehicles and/or trailer – this business typically only needs one (1) quality
                                        staff member to manage an event or “open operation” in addition to the Chef. In
                                        cases where you have a larger event, you may wish to have a second window
                                        attendant and/or assistant that could work on a part time basis when needed.

                                        franchise, you may find it beneficial to establish ordering practices to conform
                                        to your supplier’s delivery schedules. These schedules are usually planned for
                                        the greatest efficiency for the drivers. If you are restricted to accepting
                                        certain goods on specific days of the week, you will have to anticipate your
                                        needs and order so you will have enough products to last until your next

                                        Your inventory represents a substantial investment, so you should protect that
                                        investment by inspecting all goods received to be sure they are in excellent
                                        condition. Make sure perishable items are free from bruises, dents,
                                        freezer-burn, or any other signs of deterioration. Perishable items should be
                                        unpacked from original shipping containers and then properly stored. Non-food
                                        items should be delivered in unbroken, dry packaging. Never accept an order
                                        without an invoice.

                                        Before signing any invoice, check it thoroughly to be sure all items were
                                        delivered and are of high quality. Many vendors intentionally deliver a “short
                                        count” or inferior goods in the hopes that the person receiving the order will
                                        be “trusting” and sign the invoice without checking the product. <b> Only sign
                                            for
                                            the items you receive.</b>

                                        Proper inventory rotation is a must for guaranteeing the quality of ingredients
                                        used in making and preparing Kosha Hibachi menu items. Always make sure you are

                                        Many food products carry special coding to indicate freshness or production
                                        dates. You should be able to interpret these codes for proper receiving and
                                        rotation. The most effective rule of product rotation is left to right, front to
                                        back, top to bottom. Be sure your commissary regularly maintains the
                                        refrigeration equipment you are using. If you establish set procedures,
                                        employees will get into the habit of using the products in front, from the left,
                                        and at the top first.

                                            Although the cooler may be cleaned on one day, the fan, the drip pan, or the

                                        money with which to expand and innovate. However, profit is not a leftover. It
                                        should be planned for, sought after, and increased wherever possible. In fact,
                                        growth and innovation must be planned and budgeted just like any other expense.

                                        Naturally, every businessperson tries to spend less than they take in. However,
                                        the most successful managers monitor the smallest details in every area they
                                        oversee so no waste escapes their attention. They then put this “awareness of
                                        profitability” into practice every day.

                                        Employee dishonesty can be in the form of employees taking unauthorized food or
                                        beverages. To avoid this, you should establish a firm policy regarding which
                                        items, if any, employees can purchase at discounted prices. You may want to

                                        at discounted prices before or after their shifts. Whatever policy you decide to
                                        institute, follow it precisely. Let employees know that a food/beverage policy
                                        is a privilege not to be abused. All employee purchases should be rung up by the
