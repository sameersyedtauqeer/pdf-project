                                        This manual outlines policies and practices relative to the operation of a Kosha
                                        Hibachi franchise business. Additional guidelines and recommendations will be
                                        provided during Franchisee Training and on an ongoing basis throughout the term
                                        of
                                        the Franchise Agreement. Some of these recommendations may not be the most
                                        appropriate for your locale, and certain recommended business management
                                        practices
                                        may not be legally compliant with local labor laws or similar regulations.
                                        Consequently, it is your responsibility to set additional policies for the
                                        business,
                                        when necessary, and to ensure that you operate your business per the laws,
                                        regulations, and customs in your area.

                                        Not only are you solely responsible for your own business policies and

                                        but you are also accountable for the statements and actions of every person you
                                        employ. Therefore, Kosha Hibachi LLC requires that you use the advice and
                                        counsel of
                                        both a competent attorney and a CPA whenever franchise or business activities
                                        suggest such a need.

                                    A partnership is the simplest form of organization involving more than one person.
                                    It is formed merely by agreement of the partners who share the right to manage and
                                    the right to participate in the profits. Each also shares the unlimited obligation
                                    to answer personally for all the liabilities of the business.

                                    <br>

                                    Partnerships offer opportunity for more capital, more ideas, and more expertise.
                                    Very often it is the joint venture of an idea person and a money person.
                                    Partnerships relieve the responsibility of sole decision-making and sole liability.
                                    They also provide the ability to take a vacation without closing your doors.
                                    Disadvantages include the loss of sole decision-making and requirement for more
                                    paperwork as well as time and tact in interpersonal relations.

                                    Although not required by a general partnership, it is probably unwise to enter into
                                    a partnership without a written agreement. A written agreement should establish
                                    several things:
                                </p>

                                    <li> The contribution of each partner in cash, labor, or property. Equal

                                    A limited partnership is a partnership of two or more persons in which there are one
                                    or more general partners unlimitedly liable for the debts of the business with
                                    general powers of management and one or more limited partners who have no personal
                                    liability for the debts of the business (except to the extent of their capital
                                    contributions) and very limited powers of management. In order to create a limited
                                    partnership, a certificate must be filed with an appropriate state or county
                                    official and a fee paid. The limited partnership certificate bears little
                                    resemblance to corporate articles of incorporation and the state official who is
                                    authorized to accept articles of incorporation. Partnership agreements state that
                                    certain people are âlimited partnersâ or that specified persons âare not personally
                                    liable for the debts of the business.â To ensure limited liability, a certificate of
                                    limited partnership must be filed.

                                    The most common interest of small business incorporation is in the area of âlimited
                                    liability.â A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners and is taxed as
                                    a corporation apart from its owners. As an owner, creditors may not pursue your
                                    personal non-business assets for collection or damages in a lawsuit.

                                    This âlimited liabilityâ is not all encompassing. Corporate officers have
                                    âfiduciaryâ responsibilities that compel them to operate the corporation within the
                                    laws governing corporations. They are responsible for any gross negligence, criminal
                                    action, or failure in compliance with government regulations. Also, organizations
                                    that lend money to small corporations often require the stockholders or officers to
                                    co-sign as personal guarantors of the loan, thus diminishing the âlimited liabilityâ
                                    of incorporation.

                                    As a corporate officer, you may be paid an employeeâs salary, taxable to yourself,
                                    and deductible as a business expense. The remaining corporate profits not paid out
                                    as wages are subject to corporate taxes. Wages paid cannot be in excess of what is
                                    deemed âreasonableâ by the IRS according to industry standards. If wages are
                                    declared âunreasonableâ by the IRS, they may be treated as âconstructive dividendsâ
                                    and are subject to double tax, once at corporate level and once at the individual
                                    level (up to 50 percent on unearned income.)

                                </h2>

                                <p class=" s-15 fw-light align-justify">
                                    A limited liability company or LLC is a business structure that is becoming
                                    increasingly popular. The limited liability company has three main advantages:
                                </p>

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <ol class="align-justify s-15 fw-light">
                                    <li>In general, in a limited liability company, you would
                                        receive the liability protection of a corporation. Owners are not liable for the
                                        LLCâs obligations simply by virtue of their status as owners. Ownership then
                                        does not result in personal liability. </li>
                                    <li>
                                        In an LLC, you would also receive the tax benefits of a partnership. You are
                                        taxed only once on the income and gains from the business, at owner level, with
                                        generally no tax at the company level. Keep in mind, passing all federal tests
                                        for partnership tax classification does not necessarily mean that the states
                                        will extend a similar exemption from corporate tax.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Both of these advantages are then coupled with a unique flexibility in the
                                        structuring of management and member relations. Management may be retained by
                                        members, delegated to outside managers or structured anywhere between those two
                                        alternatives. LLCs may be structured under an agreement by the members or
                                        managers involved. This agreement is typically called the Regulations. The
                                        Regulations govern the internal affairs of the LLC and the relationship of its
                                        members.
                                    </li>

                                    To file for LLC status, you must have Articles of Organization. These Articles,
                                    separate from the Regulations, are similar to corporate articles of incorporation or
                                    a certificate of limited partnership. These Articles, in a sense document the basic
                                    foundation of the limited liability company. They provide information about it, and
                                    sometimes establish certain rights and obligations among the owners. To form an LLC,
                                    you must file your Articles of Organization with the appropriate state regulatory
                                    authority.

                                    Small corporations or LLCs may elect tax treatment under Subchapter âSâ of the
                                    Internal Revenue Code. In this case, profits and losses of a corporation âflow
                                    throughâ directly to the owners, who are taxed on individual income. There are

                                    as âhome baseâ for the operation and should be in a location that is convenient for
                                    loading inventory in between meals or events. This location should be on a
                                    high-traffic, but low speed limit road, allowing your trailer to get more attention
                                    from daily drivers for your operation on days that you arenât at an event.

                                    Each franchisee is required to adhere to their local laws and regulations as they

                                    Kosha Hibachi commissary, you must submit a description of the proposed site to
                                    Kosha Hibachi LLC, accompanied by a letter of intent or other evidence satisfactory
                                    to us that confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the proposed site. The

                                    The reason you will need to have a location for the Kosha Hibachi business model is
                                    because most municipalities and regulations for counties or states will require that
                                    you have a fixed location for food service operations.

                                    Food establishment operations are governed by federal, state, and local health codes
                                    (in some locales, the Department of Agriculture is the controlling agency). The
                                    various regulations they may impose deal with the care, storage, and preparation of
                                    foods, housekeeping requirements, and employee food handling and sanitary
                                    procedures.

                                    It is extremely important that you contact your local health department as soon as
                                    you have signed your lease for the commissary. Be sure you understand all of the
                                    regulations and permits required, particularly if you are having any remodeling
                                    done. All new construction must comply with local building codes. If possible,
                                    obtain as much of the information in writing so you can refer to it later. Finally,
                                    apply for all permits as soon as possible. Any problems cited by the health
                                    department could delay the opening of your business. It is most efficient to have
                                    your health permit issued for your commissary kitchen prior to the delivery of your
                                    food trailer, and a scheduled inspection date for your trailer upon its delivery.

                                    Some states require that at least one person preparing the food be a certified food

                                    handlerâs permit. In most cases, this involves the successful completion of formal
                                    coursework and an examination for a food handlerâs certificate. Also, some states
                                    require that health cards be posted, while others do not. Since regulations
                                    regarding this vary from area to area, contact your local health department and/or
                                    the Food and Drug Administration to see if this rule applies to your location.

                                    Businesses and individuals alike must pay both federal and state taxes based on the
                                    amount of income they report at the end of the year. However, businesses are
                                    required to file reports and pay taxes throughout the year as well. It is necessary
                                    to figure and report income taxes, social security taxes, and unemployment taxes. In
                                    some cases, self-employment and excise taxes also apply. Payment of such taxes is
                                    often made through a system of tax deposits using a âFederal Tax Deposit Coupon
                                    Bookâ (Form 8109) or through an electronic funds transfer payment system. An
                                    Employerâs Tax Guide (Circular E) and an IRS Tax Calendar can help you file the
                                    appropriate taxes on time.

                                    Federal income and self-employment taxes are pay-as-you-go taxes. Generally, you

                                    partners, or shareholders of an âSâ corporation pay as they go by making regular
                                    payments of estimated tax during the year. For information on estimated tax, see IRS
                                    Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.

                                    For social security tax (the FICA, or Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax), you
                                    withhold part from your employeesâ wages and you pay a matching amount yourself. An
                                    additional amount must be withheld from employeesâ wages for Medicare. Social
                                    security, Medicare, and withheld income taxes are reported and paid together.

                                    Determine the amount of income tax to withhold from each employeeâs paycheck from a
                                    tax table furnished by the Internal Revenue Service using the employeeâs gross pay
                                    for that pay period and the number of exemptions claimed by the employee (from W-4
                                    form). The tax tables to use may be found in Publication 15, Circular E, Employerâs
                                    Tax Guide. Your stateâs department of revenue can provide you with similar
                                    information about state taxes. The amount to withhold for social security is based
                                    on a percentage of the gross pay.

                                        As the owner of a Kosha Hibachi franchise, you must be skilled in a number of

                                        costs under control, for keeping your employees motivated (if applicable), and
                                        for generating increased business. Consequently, you must be actively involved
                                        in financial and problem analysis, personnel management, and innovative
                                        marketing techniques.

                                        One of the primary responsibilities of managing a Kosha Hibachi is the
                                        management of the work schedule in order to manage the business effectively and
                                        appropriately according to the amount of business and events you are attending
                                        in your area. As a franchisee, it is important to understand how your employees
                                        and people work together and to also know how to best manage your labor costs
                                        and expenses.

                                        The person operating the trailer - the Chef - is required to arrive early enough
                                        to prepare the food so they can be fully operational during our business hours
                                        of 11AM â 2PM and 3PM â 7PM. The window attendant must arrive 15 minutes early
                                        for set up and stay 15 minutes late for take down.

                                        âShiftsâ may not be necessary since employees are needed only on a case-by-case
                                        basis. Most of the time, the franchise owners themselves will be operating the
                                        vehicles and/or trailer â this business typically only needs one (1) quality
                                        staff member to manage an event or âopen operationâ in addition to the Chef. In
                                        cases where you have a larger event, you may wish to have a second window
                                        attendant and/or assistant that could work on a part time basis when needed.

                                        Your inventory represents a substantial investment, so you should protect that
                                        investment by inspecting all goods received to be sure they are in excellent
                                        condition. Make sure perishable items are free from bruises, dents,
                                        freezer-burn, or any other signs of deterioration. Perishable items should be
                                        unpacked from original shipping containers and then properly stored. Non-food
                                        items should be delivered in unbroken, dry packaging. Never accept an order
                                        without an invoice.

                                        Before signing any invoice, check it thoroughly to be sure all items were
                                        delivered and are of high quality. Many vendors intentionally deliver a âshort
                                        countâ or inferior goods in the hopes that the person receiving the order will
                                        be âtrustingâ and sign the invoice without checking the product. <b> Only sign

                                        Proper inventory rotation is a must for guaranteeing the quality of ingredients
                                        used in making and preparing Kosha Hibachi menu items. Always make sure you are

                                        Many food products carry special coding to indicate freshness or production
                                        dates. You should be able to interpret these codes for proper receiving and
                                        rotation. The most effective rule of product rotation is left to right, front to
                                        back, top to bottom. Be sure your commissary regularly maintains the

                                        <li> Remember that the upper areas of a refrigeration unit have the greatest

                                            slime or mold spores can contaminate the refrigeration unit and reproduce.
                                            Although the cooler may be cleaned on one day, the fan, the drip pan, or the

                                            clean the pans and fan blades, as well as the top of the refrigeration unit.

                                        expenses and that if you make enough profit, you will automatically have the
                                        money with which to expand and innovate. However, profit is not a leftover. It
                                        should be planned for, sought after, and increased wherever possible. In fact,
                                        growth and innovation must be planned and budgeted just like any other expense.

                                        oversee so no waste escapes their attention. They then put this âawareness of

                                        Employee dishonesty can be in the form of employees taking unauthorized food or
                                        beverages. To avoid this, you should establish a firm policy regarding which

                                        institute, follow it precisely. Let employees know that a food/beverage policy
                                        is a privilege not to be abused. All employee purchases should be rung up by the

                                        Good cash control is one of the essential features of a profitable, well-managed
                                        business. Consequently, it merits your constant attention.

                                        Keep in mind that temptation plus opportunity often leads to dishonesty. The
                                        easiest way to protect your cash is to never allow a situation to arise in which
                                        an employee or a customer finds it too easy to âtap the till.â Remember to:

                                In most cases, Kosha Hibachi trailers will be operated by the franchisees themselves as

                                supervise, and motivate additional staff will have a substantial bearing on how well
                                your business continues to succeed. Kosha Hibachi LLC charges all franchisees with

                                opportunities for advancement. Employees should also be able to count on your personal
                                respect and consideration.

                                To promote a healthy atmosphere among your staff, encourage employees to express their

                                organization should pledge to work constructively to solve problems. Give individual

                                <br>

                                Implementing a trial, or âintroductoryâ, period will help determine a new employeeâs
                                value in a mutually beneficial manner. Make it clear to the employee upon hiring that
                                this probationary time is a good way for both of you to see if the job and the employee
                                are a good match. This leaves both of you a course of action and a graceful exit if
                                there has been an error in judgment or if unforeseen circumstances arise.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                We recommend that the trial period last for 90 days. At the end of that time, prepare an
                                Employee Evaluation form and go over it with your employee. (A sample follows later in
                                this section). Make sure both you and your employee sign the evaluation. Then file it in
                                the individualâs personnel file.

                                <br>

                                Thereafter, performance evaluations conducted every six months will help ensure good
                                communication between you and your staff.

                                    When you train employees in their job duties, be organized and know what step you
                                    are going to take next. This will not only conserve time, but it will also confirm
                                    that you are disciplined, efficient, and knowledgeable. Refer to the Employee

                                <li>Provide the manager with a systematic guide for planning future training for each

                                Despite careful selection, training, and the practice of good employee relations, you
                                may eventually have an employee who does not seem to be working out. Before dismissing
                                an employee, however, you should ask yourself these questions:
                            </p>

                            <ul class="s-15 fw-light">
                                <li>Has the employee been properly motivated?</li>
                                <li>Has the employee been properly trained?</li>
                                <li>Has the employee received a proper and adequate explanation of the job?</li>
                                <li>Has the employee been allowed, even encouraged, to ask questions at any time
                                    during employment? Has the employee understood that there is no such thing as a
                                    âstupid questionâ?</li>
                            </ul>

                                Often, when an employee is not doing the job well, the honest answer to one or more of
                                these questions is âno.â Before taking irreversible action, you should look at what you
                                can do to correct these deficiencies. As with most problems, the sooner they are
                                recognized and attended to, the better. This is your opportunity to create an ally and
                                establish a better working relationship.

                                        will carefully review and test them to be sure they will be beneficial to the
                                        franchise system. We will then send them to you to be included in this manual.
                                        You will be expected to implement these new procedures in your operation.

                                        you, we all benefit by working as a team to share the techniques that can

                                        Especially critical are the opening procedures since they provide the foundation
                                        from which all other procedures follow. If the opening procedures are not
                                        correctly executed, a âdomino effectâ may be created, resulting in an
                                        unnecessary delay in opening the operation itself, general unpreparedness for
                                        ongoing daily tasks, less than satisfactory guest service, and subsequent loss
                                        of revenues.

                                        The shift change and closing procedures are also important since they conclude
                                        the shift or dayâs business and prepare the trailer and tent for the following
                                        shift or dayâs business.

                                        Opening, shift change and closing procedures, then, help set the tone and pace
                                        for the business as a whole. Therefore, they need to be conscientiously
                                        completed daily according to the guidelines set forth in this section.

                                        The purpose of the checklists on the following pages is to provide you with a
                                        well-planned procedure for opening, managing the shift change, and closing down
                                        your trailer. This helps ensure your business is operationally sound, that
                                        customers are happy, that labor costs are minimized and that you manage your
                                        time more effectively.

                                        The checklists are not meant to be all inclusive. Although prioritized to make
                                        your job easier, they are only meant to serve as a guide. Your geographic
                                        location, availability of good labor and other priorities will dictate your
                                        opening and closing needs. Use the checklist as a starting point and make
                                        changes where necessary.

                                        We typically have Sysco orders delivered at around 8:30am on Mondays for the
                                        entire week. We use a key-drop system where the Sysco delivery driver knows
                                        where a key to the commissary kitchen is hidden, he puts the food in the
                                        commercial coolers, and then locks the door on his way out. The chef arrives
                                        around 9AM and begins prepping the meats, veggies, rice, and sauce for the week.
                                        This process takes about 1.5hrs in total and all food will be prepped for the
                                        week ahead.

                                        Everything you and your staff do is directly or indirectly related to customer
                                        service. Customers should see enthusiasm and employees who take pride in the way
                                        they dress and carry out their duties. Donât think, however, that because some
                                        employees do not have the opportunity to speak personally with guests that they
                                        are not involved in guest relations. Any position, whether it is preparing the
                                        food, delivering orders to the customer, or answering the phone, should be
                                        working for guests -- keeping their satisfaction is the most important aspect of

                                        Our main objective at Kosha Hibachi is guest satisfaction and delivering the
                                        most amazing and unique experience to the customer each and every time. If a
                                        guest seems hesitant about what to order, describe our ingredients. Be prepared
                                        to answer any questions about the flavor, portion, and price of each item so you
                                        can knowledgeably make recommendations. Additionally, it would be wise to have
                                        knowledge of what ingredients are in each meal for customers with questions
                                        about allergies. Suggestive selling is an excellent way to make sure guests have
                                        remembered to order everything they need for a totally satisfying experience.

                                        discourage potential guests from visiting.

                                        Always smile when answering the phone, the caller will hear the smile in your

                                        business - it is all about service and making a connection with the customer.
                                        Your number one focus each and every day should be to deliver an amazing

                                        deliveries or the flu has affected your staff), the guestsâ primary concern
                                        while visiting Kosha Hibachi is their own satisfaction.

                                        inform the guest of the situation and provide reassurance that you will resolve
                                        the problem as soon as possible.

                                        owner/manager. If a guest asks to see the manager, have your employees relay all
                                        pertinent information about the problem to you first so you are fully prepared
                                        to assist the guest.

                                        Remember that the majority of dissatisfied guests do not complain--they simply
                                        do not come back. Your best line of defense is to prevent dissatisfaction in the
                                        first place.

                                        Do not accept any currency you suspect to be counterfeit. (Many banks offer
                                        seminars for personnel on how to identify counterfeit money. Check with your
                                        local bank for what to look for in counterfeit bills.)

                                        When a guest hands you currency, announce the amount of the sale and the
                                        denomination of the bill the guest gave you. Keep the bill in sight until you
                                        have made the correct change. Always count change back aloud.

                                        Never let a guest rush or confuse you by intimidation when paying by cash. This
                                        is common practice for con artists. If a guest claims you have not given the
                                        correct change, and you are not sure, take the guestâs name and telephone
                                        number. Politely explain that after the cash drawer has been balanced, he will
                                        be contacted if there has been an error. If a guest objects when an employee
                                        follows this procedure, the owner or manager should personally address the
                                        situation.

                                        Suggestive selling and making personal recommendations are other aspects of good

                                        Many of our guests are not familiar with our special items. As their
                                        intermediary, you are in the position to smooth the way. Above all, be sincere
                                        and honest. Always do what you truly believe is in the guestâs best interest.
                                        Recommend items you know are superior and you are certain they will enjoy.

                                        NEVER OVER SELL! Always allow the guest to finish ordering before you start
                                        suggesting. Be aware of what the guest is ordering and make sure s/he
                                        understands what they are getting.

                                        To sell effectively, you must sometimes bring a need or desire to try something
                                        to the surface. Make sure you use the right type of language.

                                        assurance of quality that has created Kosha Hibachiâs good name and reputation.
                                        Any deviations from the provided recipes (provided separately), no matter how
                                        small, will adversely affect our product. It is critical to the success of your
                                        business and to the entire Kosha Hibachi franchise system that all menu items
                                        are prepared exactly to our specifications.

                                        Daily preparation is critical to the management of a well-run operation.
                                        Personnel must follow all prep procedures. To deviate from these procedures will
                                        mean sacrificing the superior product quality and service for which Kosha
                                        Hibachi is known.

                                        guests is to wash your hands regularly. By frequently washing your hands, you
                                        wash away germs that you may have picked up from other people, from contaminated
                                        surfaces, or from animals. Once your hands pick up germs from other sources, you
                                        can easily infect yourself when touching eyes, nose, or mouth, or infect others
                                        through contaminating food or food preparation surfaces.

                                        Remember that, in addition to colds, some pretty serious diseases, including
                                        hepatitis A, meningitis, and infectious diarrhea, can easily be prevented if you
                                        and your crew make a habit of washing hands often. It is especially important to
                                        wash hands both before and after preparing or handling food, before eating, or
                                        after using the bathroom.

                                        There is a difference between cleaning and disinfecting. Cleaning generally
                                        means that dirt is being removed, while the term disinfecting means those germs
                                        are being removed. While surfaces may look clean, many infectious germs can be
                                        lurking. Under certain conditions, some germs can live on surfaces for hours and
                                        even for days.

                                        is very important to keep foods out of this temperature range. Cold temperatures
                                        keep many harmful bacteria from growing and multiplying, so make sure to
                                        promptly refrigerate unused or leftover foods.

                                        The USDA and the FDA recommend the following guidelines to ensure food products
                                        are stored at the proper temperatures:

                                            food-borne bacteria. You can use a refrigerator or freezer thermometer to
                                            check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezers.

                                            place it in the refrigerator the night before. For quick thawing, submerge
                                            food in cold water in airtight packaging. You can also use a microwave to

                                        Some general maintenance guidelines to follow to assist you in minimizing the
                                        need for equipment repair:
                                    </p>


                                    <ul class="s-15 fw-light">
                                        <li> Most mechanical equipment needs some form of lubrication. Check
                                            manufacturersâ specifications for your equipment, and make sure moving parts
                                            are lubricated properly. Lack of lubrication can lead to rapid and premature
                                            deterioration of bearings, which in turn, leads to unnecessary repair bills.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Proper circulation is the key to an efficient refrigeration system. Make
                                            sure cases of goods are not stored too close to fan coils, as this will
                                            restrict air flow and reduce a unitâs efficiency.
                                        </li>

                                        <li> Check door gaskets for cracks and other damage.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> Make sure hinges and latches are secured to the frames of coolers and
                                            freezers. Also, check door seals.
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            Make sure coolers and freezers are sitting level so doors stay shut. When
                                            a cooler or freezer door is left ajar, the compressor runs continuously
                                            since it canât maintain the air temperature because of the warm air that
                                            continues to enter the unit.
                                        </li>

                                        <li> Monitor temperatures in all refrigeration units by checking accurate
                                            thermometers on a frequent basis. Temperature change should be your first
                                            indication of a food quality problem, a service problem, or an error in
                                            operational procedures.</li>
                                        <li> Replace air filters on the heating and air conditioning system at regular
                                            intervals. The efficiency of the system is reduced because of clogged air
                                            filters. Also, replace any loose or worn belts.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Keep your back straight and bend your knees so your legs will do the work when
                                        lifting heavy objects.

                                        To minimize the chance of falls, immediately wipe up all spills, never stand on
                                        a countertop or climb on shelving, and wear rubber or non-skid-sole shoes.

                                        high.

                                        Rushing around is often a cause of accidents. Even at peak times, it is
                                        important to perform your work duties in a steady, consistent way, without
                                        rushing. At no time should there ever be running or horseplay. Always look in
                                        the direction you are walking; do not turn sharply or stop abruptly.

                                        Tools can become accident-causing agents when they are carelessly or

                                        The key to the success of any such plan is that all employees are given specific
                                        responsibilities and are instructed on how to perform these duties before the
                                        emergency occurs.

                                        <br>

                                        Train all employees in the location and use of fire extinguishers. Show all
                                        employees where the gas cut-offs are and how to turn off gas mains. Show all
                                        employees where the circuit breakers are and make sure all markings are clear.

                                        <br>

                                        Check fire extinguishers monthly. Visually check the gauge to see that the fire
                                        extinguisher is charged, and the pin has not been pulled. If the pin in the
                                        handle has been pulled, the extinguisher may have been tampered with and
                                        activated. Also, look for signs of obvious physical damage, corrosion, or other
                                        impairments. Any signs of defect should indicate that the extinguisher needs a
                                        complete maintenance check by the supplierâs service personnel. Fire departments
                                        will check these periodically, as well.

                                        yourself, your employees, and your guests from harm. Consider the following
                                        guidelines.

                                        If you suspect the trailer or surrounding area has been burglarized, contact the
                                        police immediately. Nothing should be touched until the police have arrived and
                                        have examined the premises.

                                        very valuable because they help the public recognize us. To preserve and enhance
                                        the value of Kosha Hibachi marks, all franchised locations must strictly adhere

                                        other start-up considerations. You can expect full support from the franchisor
                                        during the launch of your new business.

                                        The primary focus of the Kosha Hibachi marketing program is to use social and

                                        expected to manage social media platforms designed specifically for their
                                        business.
                                        The Corporate Office will market all franchisee locations and territories on all
                                        social media outlets. Franchisees may submit posts and/or content to the
                                        Corporate
                                        Office for approval. In addition to standard social media posts, having an
                                        individual (not the franchisee company) repost your franchisee social media
                                        posts to
                                        local groups is a great way to draw more attention and bring in new customers.
                                        It is
                                        wise to have several different types of social media posts each week: daily
                                        posts
                                        showing the food and the trailerâs location and hours for the day, weekly posts
                                        sharing that your franchise location offers catering services for private events
                                        and
                                        travels for public events, and a weekly marketing post that you ârenewâ each
                                        week.
                                        It is wiser to ârenewâ your marketing post instead of creating new marketing
                                        posts,
                                        as the comments and interactions will add up if itâs the same post, and when a

                                        When considering the purchase of radio time on a particular station, think about
                                        the demographics of the listening audience (age, gender, geographical location,
                                        income, and educational background). Purchase radio time on a station that plays
                                        the kind of music to which the people of your area listen. Marketing on public
                                        access radio and/or local radio stations may be beneficial in your area.

                                        Repetition of an ad is an important factor in radio marketing. Many believe that
                                        frequent repetition during a limited period makes a lasting impression and is
                                        more easily recalled by listeners. According to this view, it is better to buy
                                        four spot announcements in one week than it is to buy four spot announcements
                                        over a period of a month. Consult with your Field Consultant for advice on
                                        repetition frequency and its relevance to the Kosha Hibachi concept.

                                        A third consideration should be the time the radio spot runs. It may be
                                        beneficial to schedule spots when your customers are most likely to be listening
                                        to the radio. However, prime air times also carry prime rates.

                                        Participation in community festivals and events such as block parties offers a
                                        significant opportunity for you to spread the word about Kosha Hibachi. It will
                                        give you valuable exposure to both the public and other participating
                                        businesses. This is a centerpiece of the Kosha Hibachi business model. By being
                                        at local events, fairs and festivals, you create revenue opportunities for the
                                        business and marketing opportunities for our brand.

                                        As a franchisee, you should utilize various networking tools to get additional
                                        information on where events will be taking place, and how to participate. Tools
                                        that can be used include the following:

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Facebook typically has local groups that show all of the future events being
                                        held in a certain county or city; the events nearly always need food trust and
                                        this is a great opportunity for you to sign up to serve at those events. Look
                                        for events that have high attendance expectations, little or no fee to serve at
                                        the event, and fewer food trucks in attendance. It is wise to plan these events
                                        ahead of time so you have a good idea of your schedule for the next 2-3 months.
                                        Once you find some good events, ask the organizer if you can go ahead and
                                        schedule to return next year. After about a year of operating, you should have a
                                        good portion of the following yearâs events scheduled with events that you know
                                        you will do well at!

                                        You may wish to prepare your own direct mail piece, ad, or other marketing
                                        material. Before you spend any time or money on your own production, you must

                                        Consequently, Kosha Hibachi LLC suggests that you first give very serious
                                        consideration to using its marketing and promotional materials. With these
                                        materials, you will be certain to consistently maintain the Kosha Hibachi logo,
                                        theme, style, and messageâwhich benefits you and all other franchisees. While it
                                        is never our intent to stifle any franchiseeâs initiative in generating new and
                                        effective marketing or promotional material, you may find it makes sense to use
