                    This set of strategic planning questions is designed to help gather preliminary information
                    needed to structure your business’s franchise system. Many of these issues will take some
                    discussion for clarity and a thorough understanding. Don’t be concerned if you don’t have an
                    immediate answer to any particular question. I will work through each of these points with you
                    to see if the question is appropriate for your business’s franchise model in particular. If a
                    question does need to be answered for your franchise concept, I have a great deal of
                    experience in how to obtain the required information. This list is divided into three different
                    parts:

                    have all of the necessary information or feel that the question really applies. If either of these
                    are the case, please make a note that it does not apply or leave it blank. We will then take
                    some time to review each question together. After we review the document, I will begin filling in
                    the blanks and providing you with my recommendations based on our company’s experience,
                    conducting research, and on my professional background.

                Kosha Hibachi LLC is the franchisor for hibachi-style food trucks. We have a simple but enjoyable menu
                with extremely high margins compared to industry standard. We benefit from a low startup cost with high
                revenue.

                When the complete set of numbers defining the projected initial investment of the franchise offering is
                finalized, they will become part of the Disclosure Document. Each prospective franchisee needs to know
                the expected range of initial investment required to become a franchisee in your business, and also be
                aware of the individual line items that make up the total initial investment. These numbers are
                developed
                in a range from low to high, which is designed to demonstrate both favorable and unfavorable
                circumstances for each individual line item.

            <p class="text-muted s-14">
                We will want to approach the initial investment discussion with conservative estimates. Because there is
                a legal side to this franchise partnership, we would prefer to be conservative with our numbers so that
                a
                franchisee could never say that we “left something out” of the franchise estimations. Most of the
                franchisee’s individual circumstances in the program should fall within this range.
